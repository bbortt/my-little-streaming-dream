Developer codex

There is few to say at this point:
* Performance > Frameworks
* Functionality > Style
* Freedom > Rules

Please consider the `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` for each module (if exists)
before touching any code. Your pull-requests will can be reviewed and merged faster
if you follow the styles.

Don't be afraid to ask questions. It's a hard learning curve.

**Dive into the code and try it out!**
